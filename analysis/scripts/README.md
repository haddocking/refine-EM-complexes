# Annalysis scripts

### Itermolecular clashes
The intermolecular clashes are discribed as intermolecular contacts of < 2.5 A&.
This is done using the `contact-chainID.cpp` script which is assessable at [haddock-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools).
This script is called in the terminal as:
`contact-chainID <pdb-file< 2.5 | wc | awk '{print $1}'`
